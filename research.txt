abstract = {Soil moisture is a key factor that influences the productivity and energy balance of ecosystems and biomes. Global soil moisture measurements have coarse native resolutions of 36km and infrequent revisits of around three days. However, these limitations are not present for many variables connected to soil moisture such as land surface temperature and evapotranspiration. For this reason many previous studies have aimed to discern the relationships between these higher resolution variables and soil moisture to produce downscaled soil moisture products. In this study, we test four ensemble machine learning models for this downscaling task. These models use a dataset of over 1,000 sites across the US to predict soil moisture at sub-km scales. We find that all models, particularly one with a very simple structure, can outperform Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) measurements on a cross-fold analysis of the 1,000+ sites. This model has an average ubRMSE of 0.058 vs SMAPs 0.065 and an average R of 0.638 vs SMAPs 0.562. Not all ensembles are beneficial, with some architectures performing better with different training weights than with ensemble averaging. However, some ensembles capture more of the land surface characteristics than ensemble members. Lastly, although general improvements over SMAP are observed, there appears to be difficulty in consistently doing so in cropland regions with high clay and low sand content.}

To effectively quantify and attribute the antecedent conditions for wildfires, a thorough understanding of Earth system dynamics is imperative. In response, we introduce the SeasFire datacube, a meticulously curated spatiotemporal dataset tailored for global sub-seasonal to seasonal wildfire modeling via Earth observation. The SeasFire datacube consists of 59 variables including climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human factors. It offers 8-day temporal resolution, 0.25{	extdegree} spatial resolution, and covers the period from 2001 to 2021. We showcase the versatility of SeasFire for exploring the variability and seasonality of wildfire drivers, modeling causal links between ocean-climate teleconnections and wildfires, and predicting sub-seasonal wildfire patterns across multiple timescales with a Deep Learning model. We have publicly released the SeasFire datacube and appeal to Earth system scientists and Machine Learning practitioners to use it for an improved understanding and anticipation of wildfires.},

abstract = {Abstract Fire is a crucial factor in terrestrial ecosystems playing a role in disturbance for vegetation dynamics. Process-based fire models quantify fire disturbance effects in stand-alone dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and their advances have incorporated both descriptions of natural processes and anthropogenic drivers. Nevertheless, these models show limited skill in modeling fire events at the global scale, due to stochastic characteristics of fire occurrence and behavior as well as the limits in empirical parameterizations in process-based models. As an alternative, machine learning has shown the capability of providing robust diagnostics of fire regimes. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based fire model (DL-fire) to estimate daily burnt area fraction at the global scale and couple it within JSBACH4, the land surface model used in the ICON-ESM. The stand-alone DL-fire model forced with meteorological, terrestrial and socio-economic variables is able to simulate global total burnt area, showing 0.8 of monthly correlation (rm) with GFED4 during the evaluation period (2011–2015). The performance remains similar with the hybrid modeling approach JSB4-DL-fire (rm = 0.79) outperforming the currently used uncalibrated standard fire model in JSBACH4 (rm = −0.07). We further quantify the importance of each predictor by applying layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Overall, land properties, such as fuel amount and water content in soil layers, stand out as the major factors determining burnt fraction in DL-fire, paralleled by meteorological conditions over tropical and high latitude regions. Our study demonstrates the potential of hybrid modeling in advancing fire prediction in ESMs by integrating deep learning approaches in physics-based dynamical models.},

abstract = {Abstract In a model simulating dynamics of a system, parameters can represent system sensitivities and unresolved processes, therefore affecting model accuracy and uncertainty. Taking a light use efficiency (LUE) model as an example, which is a typical approach for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP), we propose a Simultaneous Parameter Inversion and Extrapolation approach (SPIE) to overcome issues stemming from plant-functional-type (PFT)-dependent parameterizations. SPIE refers to predicting model parameters using an artificial neural network based on collected variables, including PFT, climate types, bioclimatic variables, vegetation features, atmospheric nitrogen and phosphorus deposition, and soil properties. The neural network was optimized to minimize GPP errors and constrain LUE model sensitivity functions. We compared SPIE with 11 typical parameter extrapolating methods, including PFT- and climate-specific parameterizations, global and PFT-based parameter optimization, site-similarity, and regression approaches. All methods were assessed using Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), determination coefficient and normalized root mean squared error, and contrasted with site-specific calibrations. Ten-fold cross-validated results showed that SPIE had the best performance across sites, various temporal scales and assessing metrics. Taking site-level calibrations as a benchmark (NSE = 0.95), SPIE performed with an NSE of 0.68, while all the other investigated approaches showed lower NSE. The Shapley value, layer-wise relevance and partial dependence showed that vegetation features, bioclimatic variables, soil properties and some PFTs determine parameters. SPIE overcomes strong limitations observed in many standard parameterization methods. We argue that expanding SPIE to other models overcomes current limits and serves as an entry point to investigate the robustness and generalization of different models.},

    abstract = {Within a random-matrix theory approach, we use the nearest-neighbour energy-level spacing distribution $P(s)$ and the entropic eigenfunction localization length $\ell$ to study spectral and eigenfunction properties (of adjacency matrices) of weighted random-geometric and random-rectangular graphs. A random-geometric graph (RGG) considers a set of vertices uniformly and independently distributed on the unit square, while for a random-rectangular graph (RRG) the embedding geometry is a rectangle. The RRG model depends on three parameters: The rectangle side lengths $a$ and $1/a$, the connection radius $r$ and the number of vertices $N$. We then study in detail the case $a=1$, which corresponds to weighted RGGs and explore weighted RRGs characterized by $a\sim 1$, that is, two-dimensional geometries, but also approach the limit of quasi-one-dimensional wires when $a\gg1$. In general, we look for the scaling properties of $P(s)$ and $\ell$ as a function of $a$, $r$ and $N$. We find that the ratio $r/N^\gamma$, with $\gamma(a)\approx -1/2$, fixes the properties of both RGGs and RRGs. Moreover, when $a\ge 10$ we show that spectral and eigenfunction properties of weighted RRGs are universal for the fixed ratio $r/\mathcal{C}N^\gamma$, with $\mathcal{C}(a)\approx a$.},

abstract={Most real networks are too large or they are not available for real time analysis. Therefore, in practice, decisions are made based on partial information about the ground truth network. It is of great interest to have metrics to determine if an inferred network (the partial information network) is similar to the ground truth. In this paper we develop a test for similarity between the inferred and the true network. Our research utilizes a network visualization tool, which systematically discovers a network, producing a sequence of snapshots of the network. We introduce and test our metric on the consecutive snapshots of a network, and against the ground truth.},

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {The quantum chaos conjecture applied to a finite dimensional quantum system implies that such a system has eigenstates that show similar statistical properties as the column vectors of random orthogonal or unitary matrices. Here, we consider the different probabilities for obtaining a specific outcome in a projective measurement, provided the system is in one of its eigenstates. We then give analytic expressions for the joint probability density for these probabilities, with respect to the ensemble of random matrices. In the case of the unitary group, our results can be applied, also, to the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations, where the same mathematical quantities describe partial conductances in a two-terminal mesoscopic scattering problem with a finite number of modes in each terminal.}
